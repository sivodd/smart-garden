IOT SENSOR AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM INTEGRATED INTO AWS AND AN ANDROID APP

In this project, I created an automatic, Wi-Fi based, irrigation system controlled and monitored by a cellphone application. 

The project integrates between a NodeMCU, the AWS services and an Android app.
This infrastructure enables:
−	To control the "on/off" state of a garden tap.
−	To Monitor the temperature, light and soil moisture collected by sensors in the garden.

The motivation for this project came from the will to combine my love of gardening with my technological studies. I have a vegetable garden that gets watered by a timer which I set manually two times a year, winter and summer. The ability to water the garden more accurately and easily, based on weather climate, from my cellphone, can be significant in saving water and improving the plants' health.
