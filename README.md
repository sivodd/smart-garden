SMART-GARDEN: An IOT system integrated into the AWS and Android app
====================================================================

In this project, I developed an automatic, Wi-Fi based, irrigation system controlled and monitored by a cellphone application. 

The project integrates between a NodeMCU microcontroller, sensors, the AWS cloud and an Android app.
The system enables:
* _Control over the state of a garden watering system._
* _Monitor of the temperature, light and soil moisture in the garden._

The motivation for this project came from the will to combine my love of gardening with my technological studies. I have a vegetable garden that gets watered by a timer which I set manually two times a year, winter and summer. The ability to water the garden more accurately and easily, based on weather climate, from my cellphone, can be significant in saving water and improving the plants' health.
