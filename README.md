# SMART-GARDEN 
## An IOT system integrated into the AWS and Android app

In this project, I developed an automatic, Wi-Fi based, irrigation system controlled and monitored by a cellphone application. 

The project integrates between a NodeMCU microcontroller, sensors, the AWS cloud and an Android app.

__The system enables:__
* _Control over the state of the garden's watering system._
* _Monitor of the temperature, light and soil moisture in the garden._
